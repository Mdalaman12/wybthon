- **VDOM (Virtual DOM)**: Efficiently update web pages with minimal performance impact.
- **Components**: Reusable building blocks to create complex user interfaces.
- **Signals**: Manage interactions and state changes easily.
- **Tiny Router**: Navigate between views without reloading the page.

## 💡 Usage
After installing wybthon, use the following steps to start building your web application:

1. **Create a New Project**: Open a terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the folder where you installed wybthon. Create a new project folder using the command:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-wybthon-app
   cd my-wybthon-app
   ```
   
2. **Set Up Components**: Create components for your application. These components are the building blocks of your user interface. In your project folder, create a new file for each component using a text editor.

3. **Define Your Router**: Set up a routing file to manage navigation between different views. This ensures a smooth user experience.

4. **Start the Server**: You can run your application by executing the main script in the terminal:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   Or whichever file you designated to start your application.

5. **Open in Browser**: To view your application, open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or whichever port your application runs on). You should see your app in action!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
Here are some common issues and their solutions:

- **Application Doesn't Start**: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Ensure your PATH variable is set up correctly after installation.

- **Missing Files**: If you can't find certain files after extracting, double-check the downloaded archive to ensure it was properly extracted.

- **Browser Errors**: If you encounter issues in the browser, clear your cache and refresh. Sometimes, the browser stores old versions of your application.
