# Let's break down the command `python -m http.server`.
#
# `python`: This is the command to run the Python interpreter.
#
# `-m`: This is a command-line option that tells the Python interpreter to run a
# specific module as a script.
#
# Normally, when you run a Python script, you'd provide a filename, like `python
# script_name.py`. The `-m` option, however, allows you to run modules from the
# standard library or from installed packages as if they were standalone
# scripts, without needing to specify the full path to the module.
#
# `http.server`: This is the name of the module you want to run. In this case,
# it's the `http.server` module from the Python standard library.
#
# The `http.server` module provides simple HTTP servers that can be used for
# testing, debugging, or serving files temporarily. When you run `python -m
# http.server`, it starts an HTTP server on port 8000 (by default) that serves
# files from the current directory.
python -m http.server
